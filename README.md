# Dizzle
~ Simple Fast CSS Selector Engine ~

## What?
___Dizzle___ turns CSS selectors into functions that tests if elements match them. When searching for elements, testing is executed "from the top", similar to how browsers execute CSS selectors.

## Features:
* Full implementation of CSS3 selectors
* Partial implementation of jQuery/Sizzle extensions
* Very high test coverage
* Pretty good performance


## Why?
> Moving Out of jQuery & Using [PickledVanilla] has triggered me to create a library like this.
